What about floats?  Do we need float versions of all methods?  

Is there any utility in differentiating between analog sets and digital sets?  

FIFO queue as modus operandi? 

How to implement filter registration/ordering?  Follow IPTables example (insert, add, append methods)? 

How important is memory usage?  Some algorithms can be optimized for memory footprint or for CPU, but not both.  

What about iostreams?
