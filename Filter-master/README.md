Arduino data filtering library

The Filter library provides Arduino programmers with data filtering 
operations on a configurable number of recent integer values.

At this time, only integer and long inputs are supported.  Future work 
will provide functions for other numeric types (e.g. float, double).  

Until we reach a 1.x release, consider the API subject to change--
potentially a lot of change.
