Filter is based on an earlier Arduino Library project named SuperSensor.  
SuperSensor was created by Karl Ward as part of a project for the NYU ITP 
course "Introduction to Physical Computing" in Fall 2012.  The code was 
renamed "Filter" and improved over the course of an ITP in-house 
internship with Tom Igoe in Spring 2013.  

Filter used scaffold code from: 
- http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial (public domain example)

Filter owes an obvious debt to the Arduino smoothing tutorials, and Tom Igoe's 
teaching on the topics of smoothing and averaging.  

The following people have directly assisted the coding efforts by writing 
code, submitting feature requests or bug reports, or participating in the 
design: 
- Dustyn Roberts
- Clay Shirky

The following people have contributed advice, or worked on projects related to 
Filter: 
- Andrew Cerrito
- Jon Wasserman

The Arduino base libraries were also consulted for learning purposes, but no 
code was incorporated from those sources.
