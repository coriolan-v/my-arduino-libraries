paragraph=The Grove â€“ LED Matrix Driver v1.0 can be a nice helper when you need to driver a dual color LED matrix. It is built around the neat little chip STM32F103C8T6, which works at a frequency of 72MHz and very low power consumption. You can use the drivers to control a LED matrix sized at 64x32 or 32x16.
